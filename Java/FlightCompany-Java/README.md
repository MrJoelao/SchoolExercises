# FlightCompany

This project is a school exercise simulating a management system for an airline. The project was developed using NetBeans IDE and the Java programming language.

## Java version
The project was developed using Java 19.

## Classes

The project consists of several classes, each with a specific role:

- `LoginManager`: This class manages user login credentials. It can load, save, add and print credentials.

- `Credentials`: This is an internal class of `LoginManager` that represents a user's credentials.

- `MainTestLM`: This class contains the `main` method for testing the `LoginManager` class.

- `Passenger`: This class represents a passenger. It contains information such as the passenger's first name, last name and gender.

- `Ticket`: This class represents a ticket. It contains information such as flight, passenger and seat number.

## Code Choices

Code choices have been made to keep the code as simple and readable as possible. For example, we used an ArrayList to store credentials in `LoginManager` because it offers convenient methods for adding, removing and iterating.

## Resources
A number of resources are used for the tris, such as images, [icons](https://www.flaticon.com), sounds for the app. <br>
The user interface design was realised using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/9oJWv6QqZxwpa8mGM1PKss/Airline-progetto?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=SdhaPb2vjNPtnWZw-1). However, as this is a console-based project, the Figma design was mainly used as a reference for organising information and planning the code structure.

## How to run the project

To run the project, open the file `MainTestLM.java` and start running the program. Make sure you have Java 8 or later installed on your system.
