## Java Slot Machine Simulation with GUI

This project is a simulation of a slot machine, implemented in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. It was originally created as a school assignment, but I decided to upload it to GitHub to share my work.

## Features

- Realistic slot machine animations and sounds
- Jackpot and winning combination detection
- Adjustable bet and balance tracking
- Intuitive and visually appealing GUI

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing for the GUI
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com) for the slot machine icons
- [YouTube audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nz_BWvCF_4) for the background music

## Installation and Usage

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system (version 8 or higher).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MrJoelao/MySlotMachine-Java.git
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse).
4. Build and run the `SlotMachineGUI` class to start the slot machine simulation.
