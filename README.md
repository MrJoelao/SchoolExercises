# SchoolExercises

This repository is my personal collection of school exercises. It helps me store and synchronize all my schoolwork across different computers.

## Introduction

Welcome to my SchoolExercises repository! This is where I keep all the exercises and assignments I complete for school. By having everything organized in one place, I can easily access and manage my schoolwork from any computer.

## Contributing

Since this is my personal project, contributions are not expected. However, if you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request.
