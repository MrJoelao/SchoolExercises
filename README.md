# School Exercise: Store Management System
This code is a simple shop management system written in C. It uses a linked list to keep track of the products in stock. Each product is represented by a node in the list, containing information such as name, code, description, price and quantity.

The programme offers functionality to add new products, update quantities, search for specific products by code and generate invoices for purchases. It also includes basic error handling and file input/output operations to load and save product data.
